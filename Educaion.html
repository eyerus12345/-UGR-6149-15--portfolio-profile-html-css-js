              I began my educational journey in the Bole community, where I
              completed my high school education. Throughout high school, I was
              a dedicated and hardworking student, consistently striving for
              academic excellence.

            <h4>university journey</h4>
            <p>
              Currently, I am a third-year Software Engineering student at Addis
              Ababa University. My studies have deepened my understanding of
              technology and equipped me with essential skills in software
              development and problem-solving. This academic path has allowed me
              to engage in various projects, enhancing my practical knowledge
              and preparing me for a future in the tech industry.

              I have worked on numerous projects throughout my academic journey,
              each enhancing my skills and knowledge in various areas of
              technology. These projects have allowed me to apply theoretical
              concepts in practical settings and develop solutions to real-world
              challenges. I thrive in collaborative environments, and my
              experiences have strengthened my ability to work effectively in
              teams. Each project has fueled my passion for innovation and
              problem-solving, and I look forward to taking on new and exciting
              challenges in the future.
