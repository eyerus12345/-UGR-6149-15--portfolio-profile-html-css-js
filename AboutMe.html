          <h3>background</h3>
          <p>
            I began my educational journey at Bole Community School, where I
            laid the foundation for my academic pursuits. Following elementary
            school, I continued my studies at Bole Community for high school,
            where I developed a strong interest in technology and
            problem-solving. My hard work and dedication paid off when I
            successfully passed the entrance exam for university, leading me to
            pursue a degree in software engineering.

          <h3>Family</h3>
          <p>
            I am the third child and the only daughter in my family, surrounded
            by three wonderful brothers. Growing up in a supportive household
            has filled my life with joy and strength. My family has always
            worked in the private sector, and their dedication has inspired me
            to pursue my passion for technology. As a third-year software
            engineering student, I am eager to leverage my skills to help my
            family's business thrive. My goal is to develop innovative software
            solutions and a dynamic website that will enhance their operations
            and reach. Iâ€™m excited about the opportunity to contribute to our
            family legacy through technology.

          <h3>My journey</h3>
          <p>
            My school life has been a significant part of my personal growth and
            development. It all began in the Bole community, where I attended
            high school. I was known as a dedicated student, always striving to
            excel in my studies. My commitment to learning and hard work allowed
            me to build a strong foundation in various subjects. During my high
            school years, I faced challenges that tested my resilience, but I
            learned valuable lessons about perseverance and determination. I
            actively participated in class discussions, collaborated with
            classmates on projects, and sought help from teachers whenever
            needed. The friendships I formed during this time were invaluable,
            providing support and encouragement throughout my academic journey.
            Overall, my school life has been filled with enriching experiences
            that have shaped who I am today, laying the groundwork for my future
            studies and aspirations.
